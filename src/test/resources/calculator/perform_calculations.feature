Feature: Perform Calculations

  As a primary school maths student
  I want to perform various calculations
  So that I can practice my maths skills

  Background:
    Given Matt a maths student has opened the calculator

  Scenario Outline: Perform mathematical calculations
    When Matt performs the following calculation:
      | Left Operand   | Operator   | Right Operand   |
      | <Left Operand> | <Operator> | <Right Operand> |
    Then he should see a result of "<Result>"

    Examples: Additions and subtractions
      | Left Operand | Operator | Right Operand | Result |
      | 1            | +        | 2             | 3      |
      | 12           | +        | 34            | 46     |
      | 12           | -        | 5             | 7      |
      | 12           | -        | 34            | -22    |
      | 1.9          | +        | 1.9           | 3.8    |

    Examples: Multiplications and divisions
      | Left Operand | Operator | Right Operand | Result |
      | 1            | *        | 2             | 2      |
      | 2            | *        | 4             | 8      |
      | 10           | /        | 4             | 2.5    |
      | 2            | *        | 2.5           | 5      |

  Scenario Outline: Perform more calculations
    When Matt calculates "<Calculation>"
    Then he should see a result of "<Result>"
    Examples:
      | Calculation | Result |
      | 1 + 2       | 3      |
      | 2 * 4       | 8      |

  Scenario Outline: Reporting invalid inputs
    When Matt performs the following calculation:
      | Left Operand   | Operator   | Right Operand   |
      | <Left Operand> | <Operator> | <Right Operand> |
    Then he should see a result of "<Result>"

    Examples: Non-numerical characters
      | Left Operand | Operator | Right Operand | Result |
      | abc          | +        | 123           | NaN    |
      | 123          | +        | abv           | NaN    |
      | !$&          | +        | 567           | NaN    |

    Examples: Division by zero
      | Left Operand | Operator | Right Operand | Result   |
      | 1            | /        | 0             | Infinity |
      | 0            | /        | 0             | Infinity |

# Feature: Perform calculation
#    As a math student
#    I want to perform various calculations
#    So that I can practice my math skills
#
#    Background:
#      Given Matthieu is on the calculator page
#
#
#    Scenario Outline: Valid mathematical operation should give the good result
#      When he performs the operation with <first number>, "<math operation>" and <second number>
#      Then he should see "<result>" as a result
#
#      Examples: Perform additions and substractions
#        | first number | math operation | second number | result |
#        | 1            | +              | 2             | 3      |
#        | 12           | +              | 34            | 46     |

#      Examples: Perform multiplications and divisions
#        | first number | math operation | second number | result |
#        | 2            | *              | 4             | 8      |

#
#
#    Scenario Outline: Invalid mathematical operation should give a particular result
#      When he performs the operation with <first number>, "<math operation>" and <second number>
#      Then he should see "<result>" as a result
#
#      Examples: Invalid inputs reported as NaN
#        | first number | math operation | second number | result |
#        | abc          | +              | 123           | NaN    |
#        | 456          | /              | ABC           | Nan    |

#        | first number | math operation | second number | result   |
#        | 2            | /              | 0             | Infinity |
